Data analytics software is designed to analyze and interprate data to extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends. These softwares are used in various industries and sectors to make data-driven decisions, improve business processes, and gain a better understanding of the underlying data.
Key features to be implemented include:
    
    ## User Authentication:
            - User registration
            - Email verification
            - Password security
            - Password hashing
            - Account recovery
            - Session management

    ## Database:
            - Create user database t store login information.

Data ingestion is the process of importing large, unssorted data files from multiple sources into a single, cloud-based storage medium-a data warehouse, data mart or metadata-where it can be accessed and analyzed.
Types of analysis conducted:
        1. Descriptive analysis:
                # Histogram

        2. Custom analysis
                # Time series analysis
                        This is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time.
                        Data points are recorded at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly.
                        Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time.
                        It is used for non-stationary dataâ€”things that are constantly fluctuating over time or are affected by time. Industries like finance, retail, and economics frequently use time series analysis because currency and sales are always changing.

        3. Correlation heat map analysis:
                # correlation matrix heatmap you visualize the correlation coefficients between variables as a matrix of colors, where each cell represents the correlation coefficient between two variables.
                This visualization helps identify patterns and relationships between variables, with higher correlation coefficients typically represented by warmer colors (e.g., red) and lower correlation coefficients by cooler colors (e.g., blue).

        4. Correlation Scatter plot:
                # This is a statistical method used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variablesand compute their association. It calculates the level of change in one variable due to the change in the other. Correlation between two variables can be either a positive correlation, a negative correlation, or no correlation.
                A correlation heatmap is a graphical tool that displays the correlation between multiple variables as a color-coded matrix. Itâ€™s like a color chart ðŸŒˆ that shows us how closely related different variables are.

                In a correlation heatmap, each variable is represented by a row and a column, and the cells show the correlation between them. The color of each cell represents the strength and direction of the correlation, with darker colors indicating stronger correlations.

                        - Look at the color of each cell to see the strength and direction of the correlation.
                        - Darker colors indicate stronger correlations, while lighter colors indicate weaker correlations.
                        - Positive correlations (when one variable increases, the other variable tends to increase) are usually represented by warm colors, such as red or orange.
                        - Negative correlations (when one variable increases, the other variable tends to decrease) are usually represented by cool colors, such as blue or green.

        5.  Univariate Analysis:
                # It focuses on understanding the behavior and trend of a single variable (the "Value" variable) over time.
                When a line graph is used to visualize the trend of a single variable over time or across different categories, it is considered univariate analysis.
                In this context, the line graph helps in understanding the behavior and trends of a single variable.

Creating Matplotlin Histogram:
        1. Create a bin of the ranges, then distribute the whole range of the values into a series ot intervals, and count the values that fall into each interval. Bins are identified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of variables.

Inferential Statistics:
        Inferential statistics are often used to compare the differences between the treatment groups. Inferential statistics use measurements from the sample of subjects in the experiment to compare the treatment groups and make generalizations about the larger population of subjects.
         It allows you to draw conclusions based on extrapolations, and is in that way fundamentally different from descriptive statistics that merely summarize the data that has actually been measured.

Data cleaning is an essential step in the data preprocessing pipeline for any data science or analytics project. Messy, inconsistent, or missing data can lead to inaccurate insights and model predictions.
Data Cleaning Techniques with Python:
        - Handling Missing Values
        - Remove unnecessary values.
        - Remove duplicate data.
        - Avoid typos.
        - Convert data types.
        - Search for missing values.
        - Use a clear format.
        - Translate language.
        - Remove unwanted outliers.
