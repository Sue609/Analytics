Data analytics software is designed to analyze and interprate data to extract valuable insights, patterns, and trends. These softwares are used in various industries and sectors to make data-driven decisions, improve business processes, and gain a better understanding of the underlying data.
Key features to be implemented include:
    
    ## User Authentication:
            - User registration
            - Email verification
            - Password security
            - Password hashing
            - Account recovery
            - Session management

    ## Database:
            - Create user database t store login information.

Data ingestion is the process of importing large, unssorted data files from multiple sources into a single, cloud-based storage medium-a data warehouse, data mart or metadata-where it can be accessed and analyzed.
Types of analysis conducted:
        1. Descriptive analysis:
                # Histogram

        2. Custom analysis
                # Time series analysis
                        This is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time.
                        Data points are recorded at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly.
                        Time series analysis helps organizations understand the underlying causes of trends or systemic patterns over time.
                        It is used for non-stationary dataâ€”things that are constantly fluctuating over time or are affected by time. Industries like finance, retail, and economics frequently use time series analysis because currency and sales are always changing.

        3. Correlation heat map analysis:
                # correlation matrix heatmap you visualize the correlation coefficients between variables as a matrix of colors, where each cell represents the correlation coefficient between two variables.
                This visualization helps identify patterns and relationships between variables, with higher correlation coefficients typically represented by warmer colors (e.g., red) and lower correlation coefficients by cooler colors (e.g., blue).

        4. Correlation Scatter plot:
                # This is a statistical method used to measure the strength of the linear relationship between two variablesand compute their association. It calculates the level of change in one variable due to the change in the other. Correlation between two variables can be either a positive correlation, a negative correlation, or no correlation.

        5.  Univariate Analysis:
                # It focuses on understanding the behavior and trend of a single variable (the "Value" variable) over time.
                When a line graph is used to visualize the trend of a single variable over time or across different categories, it is considered univariate analysis.
                In this context, the line graph helps in understanding the behavior and trends of a single variable.

Creating Matplotlin Histogram:
        1. Create a bin of the ranges, then distribute the whole range of the values into a series ot intervals, and count the values that fall into each interval. Bins are identified as consecutive, non-overlapping intervals of variables.
